<h2>Data Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>All the data files begin with "<em>dos+ipr_</em>" to indicate the type of data stored. Each file then has the parameters used
for the simulation that mad. The order is t,U,W,mu. Where t is the hopping integral, U is the on-site interactions, W is the width of the disorder potential and mu is the chemical potential.
The name of the variable comes first and is immediately followed by it's value.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>dos+ipr_t-1U4W8mu4.0.dat</em> is for a simulation run with t=-1, U=4, W=8 and mu=4.0.</p>
