# AH-onsite
Anderson Hubbard model simulations for systems with on site interactions and nearest neighbour hoping.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains programs that can be used to calculating the density of states and the generalized inverse particiption ratio of Anderson-Hubbard tight binding model with on-site interactions for systems of 2-8 sites with a variable filling. </p> 
<p>Additional information and context about the problem begin investigated can be found in the <a href="#background"> background </a> section. Information regarding the algorithms the programs use can be found in the README files of the sub directories for each program (2site,auto etc.). To find out how to get the programs up and running immediately see the <a href="#quick">Quick Start</a> section.</p>

Depending on the size of a lattice you would like to solve go to the 2site, 3site or 4 site directory. The auto directory can do the 2,4 and 8 site versions. The only code equiped to calculate the filling is the 2site code. In the directories open the README.md file and go to the compilling and running section.
