# 3 site code for Anderson-Hubbard systems
<html>
<body>
This code is designed to compute the density of states (DOS) and generalized inverse participation ratio (GIPR) for an ensemble of three site systems with on site interactions. The single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian is used with added term for on-site interactions.
