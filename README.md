# AH-onsite
Anderson Hubbard model simulations for systems with on site interactions and nearest neighbour hoping.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains program that can be used to calculating the density of states and the generalized inverse particiption ratio of Anderson-Hubbard tight binding model with on-site interactions for systems of 2-8 sites with a variable filling. Additional information and context about the problem begin investigated can be found in the <a href="#background"> background </a> section. Information regarding the algorithms the programs use can be found in the README files of the sub directories for each program (2site,auto etc.) </p>
