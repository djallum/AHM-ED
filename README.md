<h2>Anderson Hubbard Model Simulations</h2>

<p>Anderson Hubbard model simulations for systems with on site interactions and nearest neighbour hopping for ensembles of 2,4 and 8 site systems. Calculates the denstity of states (DOS) and generalized inverser participation ratio (GIPR) through exact diaganolization.</p>

<p>Most of the information regarding the programs can be found in their indivudual directories by looking in the README files and the comments in the source code.</p>

<p>These programs were written by Patrick Daley, Dr. Rachel Wortis and Dr. Bill Atkinson all from Trent University in Peterborough, Canada.</p>
