# 3 site code for Anderson-Hubbard systems
<html>
<body>
The 3 site code is no longer being devoloped. It may be fully functional however due to the number of sites it is asymmetric (verified by checking the Anderson Model with 3 sites which is also asymetric) which makes the debugging process difficult. This is the reason for which development has been ceased.
